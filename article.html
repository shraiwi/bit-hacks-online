<p>This is a primer on binary, numbering systems, and how we can leverage the properties of the binary numbering system to do some really cool math to make our computers run faster!</p>
<p>This entire website was hand-coded from scratch and with a lot of love. I hope you learn something!</p>
<h2>What is binary?</h2>
<p>The top definition of binary on Google is:</p>
<p><em>relating to, composed of, or involving two things.</em></p>
<p>Here are some examples of binary pairs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes and no</li>
<li>On and off</li>
<li>True and false</li>

</ul>
<p>So now that we know the definition of <em>the word</em> binary, what is binary within the context of computers?</p>
<p>Well, binary is a base-two numbering system. In plain English, that means that each digit of a binary number is… well… binary. It can have one of <em>two</em> possible values: one or zero. This is opposed to the most common numbering system, decimal, whose digits can have only one of <em>ten</em> possible values.</p>
<p>When trying to understand binary, it’s important to discern between numbers and values. </p>
<p>A number is a representation of a value.</p>
<p>For example, “5” is not a value. It is a number, which represents a value. This value can also be represented by:</p>
<ul>
<li>The word “five”</li>
<li>The number of fingers on one human hand</li>
<li>The binary number 0101</li>
<li>etc.</li>

</ul>
<p>Since there’s no real-world object that <em>is</em> 5, humans have come up with standardized systems that can <em>represent</em> the value 5.</p>
<p>Binary is an example of such a system.</p>
<p>So how does it work? Let’s try to understand by figuring out how to count.</p>
<h2>How to count</h2>
<p>You&#39;re probably thinking, </p>
<p><em>&quot;Uhm. I think I know how to count...&quot;</em></p>
<p>..And you&#39;d be right.</p>
<p>But how does counting logically work? If we can figure that out, we use those rules to increment a binary number.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s start by counting from zero:</p>
<p>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, ?</p>
<p>Obviously, next number is 10, but why is it 10? Well, the reason becomes clearer when we count with numbers formatted like this:</p>
<p>00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, <strong>10</strong></p>
<p>Although this represents the same sequence, we now get an inkling as to how the number system works. </p>
<p>Firstly, when we are incrementing the number as a whole, we are actually incrementing the rightmost digit. When we increment a digit at its maximum value, we simply increment the digit to the left of it and reset the current digit&#39;s value. Keep in mind that we apply the same rules when we increment the digit to the left of the current one.</p>
<p>In this case, the rightmost digit of &quot;09&quot; was at its maximum value, so we reset it to a &quot;0&quot; and incremented the digit to the left of it from &quot;0&quot; to &quot;1&quot;, 
resulting in &quot;10&quot;.</p>
<p>When incrementing, we treat the number as if there is are infinite zeros to the left of it. These don&#39;t change the value of the number, so they are usually omitted in the written representation of the number.</p>
<p>So now that we know the rules behind decimal, let&#39;s apply it to binary!</p>
<p>Again, let&#39;s start by counting up from zero (but this time, in binary):</p>
<p>0, 1, ?</p>
<p>Our rightmost digit is at its maximum value, so let&#39;s increment the digit to the left of it and reset the current digit&#39;s value. Remember how we assume there are infinite zeros to the left of the number.</p>
<p>The rightmost &quot;1&quot; becomes &quot;0&quot;, and the implicit &quot;0&quot; to the left of it becomes &quot;1&quot;, resulting in the binary number &quot;10&quot;.</p>
<p>Counting further, we get:</p>
<p>11, 100, 101, 111, etc.</p>
<p>So now that we have the rules for counting in binary, let&#39;s try to mathematically represent it.</p>
<h2>Positional number systems</h2>
<p>Remember place values?</p>
<p>Place values are the &quot;weighting&quot; of each digit within a number. Using place values and a some arithmetic, you can easily determine the value of a number. If you remember back from second grade, each decimal digit&#39;s value is ten times more than the one to the right of it, with the rightmost number having a place value of one, like this:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Digit</th><th>3</th><th>2</th><th>1</th><th>2</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Place Value</td><td>1000</td><td>100</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<p>You could find the value of the number by summing the digits multiplied by their respective place values. Take the example from above:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Digit</th><th>3</th><th>2</th><th>1</th><th>2</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Place Value</td><td>1000</td><td>100</td><td>10</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Real Value</td><td>3 * 1000 = 3000</td><td>2 * 100 = 200</td><td>1 * 10 = 10</td><td>2 * 1 = 2</td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<p>Which has a value of 3212, which is 3000 + 200 + 10 + 1.</p>
<p>So using that representation, let’s try to figure out a general form of positional numbering systems.</p>
<p>Let’s start by writing the place values like this:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Digit</th><th>3</th><th>2</th><th>1</th><th>2</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Place Value</td><td>10<sup>3</sup></td><td>10<sup>2</sup></td><td>10<sup>1</sup></td><td>10<sup>0</sup></td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<p>Do you see anything interesting about this representation of place value? </p>
<p>Decimal is a base <em>ten</em> system, which means that all the place values are powers of ten.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a binary number’s place values:</p>
<figure><table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Digit</th><th>1</th><th>0</th><th>1</th><th>1</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr><td>Place Value</td><td>2<sup>3</sup></td><td>2<sup>2</sup></td><td>2<sup>1</sup></td><td>2<sup>0</sup></td></tr></tbody>
</table></figure>
<p>Here’s the common thread: for a base-<em>n</em> number system, a digit in position <em>p</em> (defined as the number of digits in between it and the rightmost number) will have a place value of n<sup>p</sup></p>
<p>To calculate the value of any number in any positional numbering system, sum the digits’ values multiplied by their respective place values.</p>
<h2>Bitfield Basics</h2>
<p>This is a bitfield! =&gt;</p>
<p>It is an intuitive representation of a binary number, where each checkbox represents a single bit.</p>
<p>If you hover over the bitfield, you&#39;ll see the decimal value of each bit.</p>
<p>To the right of all the checkboxes is the decimal value of the binary number.</p>
<p>While the bitfield above is <strong>eight bits</strong>, bitfields can be of all sizes!</p>
<p>(They get a lot more unwieldy as they get bigger)</p>
